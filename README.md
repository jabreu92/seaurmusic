# SEO ( Search Engine Optimization) Learnings & Fundamentals

$ Lessons Learned: 

In simple terms, SEO is how search engines such as Google rank your website against other's. It’s also the practice of increasing both the quality and quantity of website traffic, as well as exposure to your brand, through non-paid (also known as "organic") search engine results. From what I have learned, the higher your SEO score, the more likely people will find your page through search engines. There are different techniques to increase an SEO score such as: Having only one H1 tag per page, Making reference or links to website that have high SEO score, adding proper title, description & keyword Metadata. There are many other SEO strategies but in general one should follow the guidlines below:


1) Crawl accessibility so engines can read your website
2) Compelling content that answers the searcher’s query
3) Keyword optimized to attract searchers & engines
4) Great user experience including a fast load speed and compelling UX
